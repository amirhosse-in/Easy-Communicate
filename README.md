# Easy Communicate

Easy Communicate is an application designed for seamless conversations within a local network environment.

This application employs Ethernet/Raw packets to message transmission across the network. You have the option to enable anonymous mode, which allows you to utilize a spoofed MAC address. Messages are broadcasted, enabling participants within the local network to engage in the conversation.

## Getting Started

To use Easy Communicate, follow these steps:

1. Run the application.
2. Select your network interface.
3. Enter the chatroom name and password. (Participants must use the same chatroom name and password to engage in a conversation.)
4. Optionally, you can provide your name. If you provide your name, your actual MAC address will be used instead of a spoofed one.

## Features

- Option to communicate anonymously by using a spoofed MAC address.
- Broadcasted messages allow easy participation for all local network users.

## Usage

Easy Communicate provides a user-friendly interface for effective communication. Participants can swiftly connect and share messages within a secure local network environment.
